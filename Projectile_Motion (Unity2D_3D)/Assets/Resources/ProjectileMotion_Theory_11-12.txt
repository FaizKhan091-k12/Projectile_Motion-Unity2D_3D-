                                    <b>Projectile Motion:</b>

<b>Definition:</b>
Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject only to the acceleration due to gravity. The path followed by a projectile is called its trajectory, and it is typically a curved path (a parabola) under ideal conditions (neglecting air resistance).

<b>Key Characteristics:</b>
• A projectile has both horizontal and vertical motion components.
• The horizontal motion is uniform (constant velocity).
• The vertical motion is uniformly accelerated (due to gravity).
• The two motions are independent of each other.

<b>Assumptions in Ideal Projectile Motion:</b>
• Gravity acts downward with constant acceleration (g = 9.8 m/s² on Earth).
• Air resistance is neglected.
• The rotation of the Earth is ignored.

<b>Equations of Projectile Motion:</b>
Let a body be projected with initial speed u at an angle θ with the horizontal axis.

• Horizontal component of velocity = u·cos(θ)
• Vertical component of velocity = u·sin(θ)

Time of flight (T): T = (2·u·sinθ)/g  
Maximum height (H): H = (u²·sin²θ)/(2·g)  
Horizontal range (R): R = (u²·sin(2θ))/g

<b>Types of Projectile Motion:</b>
1. Horizontal Projectile – Object is projected horizontally from a height (e.g., a ball rolling off a table).
2. Oblique Projectile – Object is projected at an angle with the horizontal.

<b>Effect of Variables:</b>
• Speed: More speed means longer range and higher height.
• Angle: 45° gives maximum range (in ideal conditions).
• Height: Higher launch point gives more time in air.
• Gravity: Lower gravity (like on the Moon) increases range and flight time.
• Air Resistance: Reduces range and makes the motion non-symmetric.

<b>Practical Applications:</b>
• Sports (throwing, jumping, archery)
• Engineering (trajectory prediction for structures and machines)
• Ballistics (gunfire, missiles)
• Space science (launching spacecraft)

<b>Learning Outcomes:</b>
By studying this simulation, students will be able to:
• Understand the kinematics of two-dimensional motion.
• Break motion into horizontal and vertical components.
• Apply equations of motion to real-life projectile problems.
• Predict the effect of variables like angle, speed, and height.
• Appreciate the relevance of physics in everyday life and technology.
